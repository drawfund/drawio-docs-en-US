# Snap to Point

### Ignore custom connection points

You can [force a floating or fixed connection at any location](https://diagrams.net/doc/faq/connect-to-shapes-anywhere.html) by using a keyboard shortcut, even if the shape has custom connection points or the *snap to point*shape property enabled.

- Hold down Shift as you drop the connector on a shape to connect it to the shape's outline.
- Hold down Alt as you drop the connector on a shape to add a fixed connection inside the shape.
